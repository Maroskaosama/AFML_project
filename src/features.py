"""
Stage 3 — feature engineering.

All microstructure measures here are *daily-OHLCV approximations* of the
intraday quantities described in AFML Ch 19. In particular:

- Corwin-Schultz: derived from daily H/L/L_prev/H_prev. The estimator can
  produce alpha < 0 (and therefore a negative spread) when its no-arbitrage
  assumptions are violated by the data; with daily bars these violations are
  more frequent than with intraday data. We follow Corwin & Schultz (2012)
  and AFML Ch 19 by flooring the spread at 0.
- Bekker-Parkinson: uses (1/(4 ln 2)) * [ln(H/L)]^2, which is non-negative
  by construction.
- Amihud: |log return| / dollar volume, smoothed by a 20-day mean. Tiny
  in absolute terms when dollar volume is in billions — that's expected.
- Roll: 2 * sqrt(-cov(dp_t, dp_{t-1})). When the rolling covariance is
  positive (the model's mean-reverting-noise assumption fails) we floor
  the input at 0 so the square root is real, equivalent to reporting
  "no estimable spread" for that window.

def lempel_ziv_complexity(binary_sequence, normalize: bool = False) -> float:
    """
    Lempel-Ziv (LZ-76) complexity of a binary sequence.

    Implements Kaspar & Schuster's (1987) production-rule algorithm:
    we walk a pointer along S; for each position we look for the longest
    word starting there that has already appeared anywhere to its left.
    Each time the prefix-matching pointer reaches the start of the
    current (yet-unparsed) tail, we have just identified one new
    production and increment the complexity counter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    binary_sequence : 1-D iterable of ints/floats coercible to {0, 1}.
    normalize : bool
        If True, divide by n / log2(n) (the asymptotic upper bound for a
        uniformly random binary string of length n). Normalised values
        sit in [0, ≈1] regardless of window length, which is what we want
        when this function is called inside a rolling window of fixed
        size.

    Returns
    -------
    float (or int when normalize=False).

    Notes
    -----
    The previous in-repo implementation had off-by-one index pairs in the
    inner comparison and never advanced the production counter for any
    realistic input — every rolling window collapsed to the initial value
    of 1. This implementation is the textbook one and matches the
    Kaspar-Schuster reference: `'0010'` → c = 3, an all-zero string of
    length 32 → c = 2, and an alternating 32-bit string → c = 3.
